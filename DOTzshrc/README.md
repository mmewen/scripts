.zshrc
=======
My custom conf file for zsh.
 
### Explanations

Actually, there's not much change in the conf. The most interesting part -for me-, are the aliases at the end of the file.

### Setup

* Install `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh` (I don't remember how I did it, FIX ME)
* Run `ln -s ~/dev/scripts/DOTzshrc/DOTzshrc ./.zshrc` if I assume you cloned this repo in a ~/dev/ folder.
