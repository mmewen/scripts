# Scripts
## Some small scripts to make my life -a bit- easier

Take a look at each folder's Readme to know more about the content and how to install it (in progress).

### Current stuff
* `calc` : a python terminal script that evaluates its arguments
* `get-wallpaper` : a Bing background downloader for Gnome Shell wallpaper
* `wacom` : a .sh script to setup my Wacom Bamboo tablet as I want
* `DOTzshrc` : a zsh conf file that declares my favourite aliases

### To do
* Add installation Readmes
