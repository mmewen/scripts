get-wallpaper
=======

A small Python script to download the Bing picture everyday and set it as my Gnome Shell wallpaper

## Setup

* Edit the /path/to/this/repo/get-wallpaper.sh script to match your path
* Copy the script to the init.d dir : `sudo cp /path/to/this/repo/get-wallpaper /etc/init.d/get-wallpaper`
* Run `sudo update-rc.d get-wallpaper defaults`

##

* Think about making an INSTALL.sh
